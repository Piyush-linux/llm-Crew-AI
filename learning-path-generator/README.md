## Overview
This system uses AI Agents to simulate a collaborative team that:
1. **Designs a curriculum** tailored to a specific subject.
2. **Curates resources** aligned with the curriculum.
3. **Tracks progress** through assessments and milestones.

The goal is to streamline the process of creating effective learning paths for any subject, leveraging AI expertise in educational design.

## Features
- **Collaborative AI Agents**:
  - Curriculum Designer: Breaks down complex topics into manageable modules.
  - Resource Curator: Finds high-quality, diverse learning resources.
  - Progress Tracker: Tracks learner progress with assessments and milestones.
- **Customizable Input**: Specify subject, student level, and goals.
- **Comprehensive Output**: A complete learning path with modules, resources, and assessment plans.

## Usage
0. Pre installed (crewai)
1. Create venv
2. Install the required dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Define your inputs: `main.py`

4. Run the system:
```bash
crew run
```
